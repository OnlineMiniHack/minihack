# Task

You are provided with 6 Jigsaw pieces

They fit together in the following formation:

---
    1.png  |  2.png  |  3.png
    4.png  |  5.png  |  6.png

---

The brief for MiniHack 1 is to create something that uses at least one of these images



## Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited):

* Animate the pieces slotting together
* Allow the user to arrange the pieces together
* Use AI to fit the pieces together
* Create a program that displays metadata about one of the pieces
