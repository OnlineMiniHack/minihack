            <p>
                Easter is a religious holiday, but some of its customs, such as Easter
                <a href="#" onclick="appendEggImage()">EGGS</a>, are likely linked to pagan traditions.
                The egg, an ancient symbol of new life, has been associated with pagan festivals celebrating spring. From a Christian perspective,
                Easter eggs are <a href="#" onclick="sayHappyEaster()" class="bold-link">said</a> to represent Jesus’
                emergence from the tomb and resurrection. Decorating eggs for Easter is a tradition that dates back to at least the 13th century,
                according to some sources. One explanation for this custom is that eggs were formerly a forbidden food during the Lenten season,
                so people would paint and decorate them to mark the end of the period of penance and fasting, then eat them on Easter as a
                celebration.

                Easter egg hunts and egg rolling are two popular egg-related traditions. In the U.S., the White House Easter Egg Roll, a
                race in which children push decorated, hard-boiled eggs across the White House lawn, is an annual event held the Monday
                after Easter. The first official White House egg
                <a href="#" onclick="roll()" class="big-link">roll</a> occurred in 1878, when Rutherford B.
                Hayes was president. The event has no religious significance, although some people have considered egg rolling symbolic of
                the stone blocking Jesus’ tomb being rolled away, leading to his resurrection.

                The dyeing of Easter eggs in different colours is commonplace, with colour being achieved through boiling the egg in natural
                substances (such as, onion peel (brown colour), oak or alder bark or walnut nutshell (black), beet juice (pink) etc.), or
                using artificial colourings.

            <p>
                A greater variety of <a href="#" onclick="colour();" class="italic-link">colour</a> was often provided by tying
                on the onion skin with different coloured woollen yarn. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, 
                from a dialectal form of Middle English pasche. King Edward I's household accounts in 1290 list an item of ‘one shilling and
                sixpence for the decoration and distribution of 450 Pace-eggs!’, which were to be coloured or gilded and given to members of the
                royal household. Traditionally in England, eggs were wrapped in onion skins and boiled to make their shells look like mottled gold,
                or wrapped in flowers and leaves first in order to leave a pattern, which parallels a custom practised in traditional Scandinavian
                culture. Eggs could also be drawn on with a wax candle before staining, often with a person’s name and date on the egg. Pace Eggs
                were generally eaten for breakfast on Easter Sunday breakfast. Alternatively, they could be kept as decorations, used in egg-jarping
                (egg <a href="#" onclick="tap()" class="highlighted-link">tapping</a>) games, or given to Pace Eggers.  In more recent centuries in
                England, eggs have been stained with coffee grains or simply boiled and painted in their shells.
