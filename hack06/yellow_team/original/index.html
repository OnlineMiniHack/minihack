    <h1>Easter Eggs</h1>

    <p>
        Easter is a religious holiday, but some of its customs, such as Easter <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none;" onclick="petesEasterEgg()">EGGS</a>, are likely linked to pagan traditions. The
        egg, an ancient symbol of new life, has been associated with pagan festivals celebrating spring. From a Christian
    perspective, Easter eggs are <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold" onclick="speakText('Happy Easter to you!')">said</a> to represent Jesus’ emergence from the tomb and resurrection. Decorating eggs for
    Easter is a tradition that dates back to at least the 13th century, according to some sources. One explanation for this
    custom is that eggs were formerly a forbidden food during the Lenten season, so people would paint and decorate them to
    mark the end of the period of penance and fasting, then eat them on Easter as a celebration.

        Easter egg hunts and egg rolling are two popular egg-related traditions. In the U.S., the White House Easter Egg Roll, a
        race in which children push decorated, hard-boiled eggs across the White House lawn, is an annual event held the Monday
        after Easter. The first official White House egg <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight:bold" onclick="roll()">roll</a> occurred in 1878, when Rutherford B. Hayes was president. The
        event has no religious significance, although some people have considered egg rolling symbolic of the stone blocking
        Jesus’ tomb being rolled away, leading to his resurrection.

    The dyeing of Easter eggs in different colours is commonplace, with colour being achieved through boiling the egg in natural substances (such as, onion peel (brown colour),
    oak or alder bark or walnut nutshell (black), beet juice (pink) etc.), or using artificial colourings.</p>
    <p>
    A greater variety of <a href="#" style="text-decoration: none" onclick="colour()"><i>colour</i></a> was often provided by tying on the onion skin with different coloured woollen yarn. In the North of England these are called pace-eggs or paste-eggs, 
    from a dialectal form of Middle English pasche. King Edward I's household accounts in 1290 list an item of ‘one shilling and sixpence for the decoration and distribution of 
    450 Pace-eggs!’, which were to be coloured or gilded and given to members of the royal household. Traditionally in England, eggs were wrapped in onion skins and boiled to make 
    their shells look like mottled gold, or wrapped in flowers and leaves first in order to leave a pattern, which parallels a custom practised in traditional Scandinavian culture. 
    Eggs could also be drawn on with a wax candle before staining, often with a person’s name and date on the egg. Pace Eggs were generally eaten for breakfast on Easter Sunday breakfast. 
    Alternatively, they could be kept as decorations, used in egg-jarping (egg <a href="#" onclick="tap()">tapping</a>) games, or given to Pace Eggers. 
    In more recent centuries in England, eggs have been stained with coffee grains or simply boiled and painted in their shells.
