# Task

The theme for MiniHack 6 is Easter.  The task this month is to create an "Easter Egg" hunt.  

An Easter Egg (as far as a computer program or game is concerned) is something in the program that is unexpected and hidden.  You should hide as many easter eggs as you can around; however, there should be subtle hints and clues as to where the next one can be found.




# Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited and some of these may take considerably more time than you have available):

* A console application that asks your name and address (with an example), but when you enter a specific name (perhaps an anagram of the example), it displays a funny message
* A website that celebrates Easter, but when you hover over a specific part of the screen, an animated gif displays
* A plug-in for Chrome that changes the website that you visit if you press a certain key combination
