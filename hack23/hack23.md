# Task

## Overall Story so far

During your time at the races, you resolved disputes, helped the jockeys pick colours, simulated races for them, and even given them something to do while riding (other than racing).

You're surprised to receive a phone call from one of the jockeys the week after you're back!



### The Jockey Club

Everyone at the races used to share a common social media site - called The Jockey Club.  However, recently, The Jockey Club has been bought up by a wealthy car mechanic Eileen Munch, and she's started charging some of the members for its use.



## The Task

Design a common place where jockeys, owners, trainers, and anyone else with an interest can exchange ideas.


# Suggestions

* An Excel or Google Spreadsheet that collates entries.

* A console application that records entries and then displays entries from other people.

* A website that allows people to add entries and displays those from other users.
