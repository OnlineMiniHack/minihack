# Task

The theme for mini Hack 8 is trains.

The task is to create a system that manages train schedules based on the following information:

Station: MAN
Time to EUS: 2' 10"
Time to BNS: 1' 30"

Station: EUS
Time to MAN: 2' 10"
Time to BNS: 1' 40"

Station: BNS
Time to MAN: 1' 30"
Time to EUS: 1' 40"

One in every 5 journeys is delayed by more than 10", and one in every 20 journeys is delayed by more than 30"

2,000 people per hour travel between Birmingham and London

3,000 people per hour travel between London and Manchester

1,500 people per hour travel between Manchester and Birmingham


# Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited and some of these may take considerably more time than you have available):

* Create a simple text based application that calculates the times and displays them
* Create an AI algorythm to calculate the best times to run the trains
* Create an interactive board that allows a user to edit the times and projects passenger numbers
* Create a game that lets you play with stations and times
* An Excel sheet that contains the times and provides projected journey length
