# Task

## Background

Your team are, one, day, magically transported into a parallel universe.  In this world, Windows Vista is hailed as the pinnacle of software development, Lotus Notes rules supreme, and they only program is esoteric languages.  Everything that we believe about IT in this universe is inverted.  Suspecting that your team has come from a different universe, you're arrested and forced to write bad software.


### The Upside Down

You must convince the software police that you are from their universe to win your freedom.  You must create something that is so obfuscated and poorly written, or created with such obscure tools that there will be no doubt as to where you are from.


## The Task

Create something that can be used as a beacon back to your own universe to request help.  However, the challenge is to create this using the worse possible tool choice for the job.  If you're using a programming language, use an esoteric one, or just write the code in the most obfuscated way possible.  If not, make the most ridiculous choice of software that you can.

# Suggestions

* Use one of the esoteric programming languages to create an application that flashes a message on the screen requesting help (such as Ook, BF, Beatnik, Befunge, Rockstar, LOLCODE, or one of the others).

* Using a standard programming language, find a way to make the code so unreadable and poorly written that it cannot be read.

* Encode the code itself into another format, such as an image or a sound.
