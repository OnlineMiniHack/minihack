# Task

## Overall Story so far

You were having a great time at the racetrack after a recent windfall.  
However, the jockeys have gone on strike.  
In the last hack, you simulated a race for the racetrack, but this has made matters worse.
The jockeys now fear that they'll be replaced by a simulated race.
The jockey's union are involved, and there is a wholesale dispute over pay, computer simulations, conditions, and hay for the horses!


### The Negotiation

You have been approached by three of the jockeys.  They've asked that you create them something that will help them to negotiate pay.
At the same time, you've been approached by the racetrack, who have asked the same thing.


## The Task

If your team number is even, then create a negotiation solution for the jockeys; if it's odd, for the racetrack.

The only rules are that a file must be produced during each negotiation phase, and consumed if one is already there.


# Suggestions

* A simple console application that reads a text file and writes a response.

* Using machine learning and language understanding to determine what has been written and respond.

* Create an Excel macro that consumes the file and allows a response.
