# Task

The theme for Hack 4 is Locked In.  You're part of a crack team of spies, who are breaking a high value asset out of prison.  We're able to drop a parcel to them before the rescue, so that they can let us know the best time to rescue them.  Build something that, based on a real world (or simulated real world event) event, performs an action that will communicate with the outside world.

You can use real or virtual hardware for this task.


# Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited and some of these may take considerably more time than you have available):

* Using one of the simulators below, design a button that causes a light to flash to indicate the rescue time.
* Using an Arduino (or simulator) create a motion detector that sends a Tweet alerting the team of the best rescue time.
* Create a system involving buttons and servo motors that will display a series of flags.
