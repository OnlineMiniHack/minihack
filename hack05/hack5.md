# Task

The theme for MiniHack 5 is Valentines Day.  Your friend has forgotten about valentines day - since we're in lockdown (or at least we were when I came up with this), they want you to help them out by creating a virtual valentines card or gift.

Whatever you produce must either be virtual (i.e. transmittable by e-mail), or small enough to fit in a jiffy bag.


# Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited and some of these may take considerably more time than you have available):

* A console application that displays a message when run (e.g. "Happy Valentines Day")
* A small Arduino board with a matrix display that shows a heart
* A website that displays a bunch of flowers
* An interactive website that spells out the recipient's name in a virtual firework display
* An Microbit that plays some soppy love song
