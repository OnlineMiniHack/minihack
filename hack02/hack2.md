# Task

The task for Hack 2 is to create a game with no graphics.

The game can be anything you like, providing it does not render graphics.  You can interact with the user via other medium, for example, outputting sound, causing an IoT motor to start, etc...


## What is considered 'Graphics'?

This is open to imterpretation; however, as a minimum, the produced solution should not, itself, generate or display any image, or arrange pixels in the form of an image; save for those that are generated automatically by the chosen technology or framework.

So, it's fine to display text in a console application, but you can't use something to display a image on the screen.



# Suggestions

The following are some suggestions to give a feel for the sort of thing you might attempt (remember time is limited):

* A ZX80 style text adventure
* Guessing game (e.g. 20 questions)
* A game played entirely in memory (e.g. Conway's Game of Life)
* A game using an IoT device as an output medium
* Guess the instrument (audit output)
