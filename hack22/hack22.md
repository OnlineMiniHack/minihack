# Task

## Overall Story so far

You were having a great time at the racetrack after a recent windfall.  
However, the jockeys have gone on strike.  In the last hack, you attempted to help resolve the strike.

After an eventful day at the races, you're ready to come home.  On the way out, you encounter a gang of jockeys on their way back from the picket line.  They look forlorn.


### The Goodbye Gift

The jockeys ask that you make them a game that they can play - while riding the horse.  Since they need their hands while riding, the game must adapt to that restriction.


## The Task

Create a game that fits within a smart-phone form factor, or on a device of a similar size, but which can be played without physically interacting with the device.  That is, it must not require touch, keyboard, or mouse input.
