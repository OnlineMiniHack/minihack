# Task

## Background

You live in a dystopian near future where aliens have enslaved humanity.


### Terminator

You are part of a team that has invented a time machine.  The time machine works by glowing red and white, and then transports a team of no more than 6 people into the past.

Sadly, there are two problems with the time machine: it *only* transports you back to 21/2/1980, and you can each only take a single item with you (that includes the computer and monitor, etc...).

The aim of the first trip is to create something that will advance humanity by simply showing it to someone in 1980.


## The Task

Create something that will advance humanity by simply showing that thing to a person in 1980.  You can show this to whomever you choose: the prime minister, the president, Lemmy, Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, or anyone you choose.

The only criteria is that, by seeing this, you change history such that humanity is better able to repel the alien invasion.

Since you're traveling back in time, you're not allowed to use any public APIs, or anything that's on the internet (that wasn't available in 1980 - the WWW was invented in 1989).  You can download items to your machine (such as nuget packages) before you leave, but the final demo needs to run in 1980.


# Suggestions

* Show the new version of Excel to Bill Gates with formulas and pivot tables so that the development of spreadsheets is brought forward years.  No aliens would dare attack a society with a lot of spreadsheets - as anyone that has ever seen them used in business will attest to.

* Create a game simulates an alien invasion and show it to an army general so that they are ready for the attack.

* A noughts and crosses game which, when showed to the aliens after they invade, will send them into a War Games style meltdown.

* A public information BBS that advises against hospitality to aliens.
