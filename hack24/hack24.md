# Task

## Background

It's the far future (the year 2190), and people survive by participating in a publicised game-show, whereby they are put into a maze and have to find the centre of the maze.  


### The Maze

You work for the company that designs these mazes.  Your team have just been put in charge of designing the newest maze.



## The Task

Design a maze.  There are no rules around what the maze looks like; however, there must be a prize somewhere in the maze; also, it must be solveable (it can't be impossible to find the prize), and you should be able to prove this.  The maze should have at least one booby trap.


# Suggestions

* Use Excel to design the maze with cells representing the walls and traps.  Use the cursor to navigate through it.

* A game designed using a game framework, such as Monogame or Unity that displays the maze and allows the player to move through it.

* A web application that designs a random maze based on user criteria.
